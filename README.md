# My JavaScript(React) Project

###### It is a website developed in Javascript(React), Css, PHP and Json. I realized this project during my licence. The objective of this project was to develop the Javascript part with React. The front-end was not the priority

<sub> :warning: **Information** : To see the Website of this project you must have wamp or mamp or other... because there is a php part to save the different data </sub>
